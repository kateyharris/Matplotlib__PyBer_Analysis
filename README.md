# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Below find a summary of the PyBer ride-share data by three defined city types (urban, suburban, and rural). The chart show the Total fares by city type.
## Results:
	1) A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
    
	2) A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type by week from January, 2019 through April, 2019 (Note that Rural fare totals are the lowest, and Urban fare totals are the highest.)
 
         - Twice during the time period, Urban fares reached $2,500 for a single week.
         - There is one week, at the beginning of the year, for the Rulal cities, that had close to zero in fares collected. 
.
## Summary:
Based on the analytics of total fares by city type, I would recommend focussing resources in both the Suburban and Urban cities first. Urban cities show the highest potential for profits, and should be the primary focus. Furthur analysis over longer periods of time for future analysis is highly recommended. With a larger data set, patterns on what periods of time are more inclined to collect higer fares could be identifed then. Perhaps also, some additional advertising to Rural customers could drum up some more business there.
